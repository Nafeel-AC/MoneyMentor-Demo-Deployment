Generate a 10-page course on "{focus_topic}" at the {course_level} level, based on the following diagnostic results:

**Student Performance:**
- Overall Score: {overall_score}%
- Course Level: {course_level}
- Focus Topic: {focus_topic}

**Topic Performance Breakdown:**
{topic_summary_text}

        {{"title": "Page Title", "content": "Page content (max 500 chars)..."}},
